- **collect** normalizes the target (file/dir/API) into records.
- **rules/analyzers** apply the heuristics shipped in `uefiscan/core.py`.
- **score** ranks by severity.
- **MCP server** (`uefiscan mcp`) exposes `scan` for Cognis.Studio agents.

Extend by adding a rule + a test + a `demos/NN-*/SCENARIO.md`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
